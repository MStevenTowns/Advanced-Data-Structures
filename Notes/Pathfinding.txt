Dijkstra's Algorithm
Discovers shortest path from starting node and all other nodes
uses priority queue

begin w/ vertex u(color it grey), assume d=0
adjacent are v:2, w:5, x:1
assign distance to each one
then go to node x(color it grey)
assign distance to each of it's neighbor (if less than current d)

NEVER LET WEIGHT <=0


BINARY HEAP IS ON THE TEST

special case in AVL Tree
